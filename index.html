            <p>
               Welcome to my website! I’m a Ph.D. candidate in Second Language Studies at the University of Hawai‘i. My research explores how we acquire and process first and additional languages using psycholinguistic methods, with a special focus on (morpho)syntax. I aim to uncover insights that deepen our understanding of language representations and their real-time use.

            <br>
              <br>Outside academia, I enjoy hiking scenic trails and singing my favorite tunes. The background picture was taken on one of the beautiful trails on O‘ahu Island.
            <br>
              <br>Feel free to check out my <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1AKOgKoauEgnXiZOSN0oS3or3jw1fipzY/edit?usp=drive_link&ouid=113508916746807435540&rtpof=true&sd=true">CV</a> to learn more about me!
